Let's enhance the [Hello World app](/tutorial/ng1/helloworld) and create a slightly more ambitious Hello Solar System app.

We will implement a [list/detail interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93detail_interface)
(also known as master-detail) by creating new application states which:

- Show a list of people.
- Show a specific person's details.

Additionally, we will switch our views from templates to components.

At any time, the user can click "reload plunker", and the app will restart.
The URL contains the information necessary to restore the application's state.
When the app is restarted, it will be in the same state as before.

## Live demo

Take a look at the Hello Solar System live demo below.
Click the `ui-sref` labeled "People" to view a list of people.
Click a person to view the person details.

As you navigate through the app, the [UI-Router State Visualizer](https://github.com/ui-router/visualizer) shows
the current state

# New concepts

This app introduces some new concepts and UI-Router features.

## Route to component

Although UI-Router allows you to define your views using arbitrary `template` and `controller` combinations, we
recommend instead that you adopt a component based architecture.

Angular 1.5 introduced the `.component()`, which is a special class of directives.
A component encapsulates a template and a controller as a single unit, and also explicitly defines its
inputs (data) and outputs (events).
To learn more, read the official [Angular 1.5+ component docs](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/component),
and explore a [blog](https://toddmotto.com/exploring-the-angular-1-5-component-method) or two.

---

To route to a component that you have created, add a `component: 'myComponentName'`
property on your state definition (and do not use `template:` or `controller:` properties).

The Hello Solar System `hello` component:

{% raw %}
```js
angular.module('hellogalaxy').component('hello', {
  template:  '<h3>{{$ctrl.greeting}} Solar System!</h3>' +
             '<button ng-click="$ctrl.toggleGreeting()">toggle greeting</button>',
           
  controller: function() {
    this.greeting = 'hello';
  
    this.toggleGreeting = function() {
      this.greeting = (this.greeting == 'hello') ? 'whats up' : 'hello'
    }
  }
})
```
{% endraw %}

... and the Hello Solar System `hello` state definition:

```js
var helloGalaxy = {
  name: 'hello',
  url: '/hello',
  component: 'hello'
}
```

The string `'hello'` in `component: 'hello'` is the name used to register the component, i.e., `.component('hello', ...)`
{: .notice--info}

## Resolve data

When a user switches back and forth between states of a single page web app, it often needs to fetch
application data from a server API, such as a REST endpoint.
A state can specify what data it requires using a `resolve:` block.
When the user wants to activate a state with a `resolve:` block,
UI-Router will fetch the required data *before activating the state*.

A `resolve:` block is an object on a state definition.  Each key is the name of some data to load, and each value
is a function that returns a promise for the data.  
Resolve functions are injected using Angular's injector.
{: .notice--info}

The Hello Solar System `people` state has a resolve block:

```js
var peopleState = {
  name: 'people',
  url: '/people',
  component: 'people',
  resolve: {
    people: function(PeopleService) {
      return PeopleService.getAllPeople();
    }
  }
},
```

When fetching data, we recommend delegating to services which return promises.
{: .notice--info}

Resolved data is mapped to the component's input `bindings:` by name.
The Hello Solar System `people` component has a `bindings:` with an input `people` that matches the resolve's name:

{% raw %}
```js
angular.module('hellogalaxy').component('people', {
  bindings: { people: '<' },

  template: '<h3>Some people:</h3>' +
            '<ul>' +
            '  <li ng-repeat="person in $ctrl.people">' +
            '    <a ui-sref="person({ personId: person.id })">' +
            '      {{person.name}}' +
            '    </a>' +
            '  </li>' +
            '</ul>'
})
```
{% endraw %}

UI-Router waits until the promise returned from `PeopleService.getAllPeople()` resolves before activating the `people` state.

## Parameters

We also want to allow the user to view the details for a specific person.
The `person` state takes a `personId` parameter, and shows that specific person's details.

The parameter value is included as a part of the URL.
This enables the same person details to be shown when the plunker is reloaded.

The `person` state definition:

```js
{
  name: 'person',
  url: '/people/{personId}',
  component: 'person',
  resolve: {
    person: function(PeopleService, $stateParams) {
      return PeopleService.getPerson($stateParams.personId);
    }
  }
}
```

The URL will reflect the current `personId` parameter value, e.g., `/people/21`
{: .notice--info}

The resolve delegates to PeopleService to fetch the correct person.
It passes the `personId` parameter from the injected `$stateParams` object.
{: .notice--info}

### Linking with params

Note that our app's nav bar links to three states: `hello`, `about`, and `people`,
but it doesn't include a link directly to the `person` state.
This is because the state cannot be activated without a parameter value for the `personId` parameter.

In the `people` state we create links to the `person` state, for each person in the `people` list.
We still create the link using `ui-sref`, but we include the `personId` parameter value, for each person object's `.id` property.

{% raw %}
```js
  <li ng-repeat="person in $ctrl.people">
    <a ui-sref="person({ personId: person.id })">
      {{person.name}}
    </a>
  </li>
```
{% endraw %}

To pass parameters to a state using `ui-sref`, add parenthesis after the state name.  
An expression string inside the parenthesis is used as the target state parameter key/value pairs.
The expression is evaluated against the enclosing scope.
