## Development

To fix a UI-Router bug, or create an enhancement, follow these steps: 

The Typescript source code for UI-Router for React can be found at https://github.com/ui-router/react
The react code depends on the UI-Router Core code, found at https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router

To get started you will need to clone the UI-Router Core and UI-Router React repositories.

```
git clone https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router
git clone https://github.com/ui-router/react
```

Then, you will need to build ui-router core and link it locally using `npm link`

```
cd ui-router
npm install
npm test
./scripts/package.sh core
cd build_packages/core
npm link
```

Then, link to it from the ui-router-react repository

```
cd ../../../react
npm install
npm link ui-router-core
```
