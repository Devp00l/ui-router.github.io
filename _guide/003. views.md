A view provides the UI and UI behavior for a state.
A state's view is a component, which consists of both markup and logic.
The view is plugged into the matching `<ui-view>` viewport directive.

Note: `ui-view` can either be an element (as we've seen it so far), or an attribute of some
other element, such as `<div ui-view></div>`
{: .notice--info}


# Multiple named views

Up until now, we've defined a single view per state.  Those views filled in the *unnamed viewport* (`<ui-view>`).
However, UI-Router allows *multiple views* for a single state.    This can be useful to define a layout with
named sections.  For instance, you may want a layout with a header, navigation and content.

```
+-------------------------------------------+
|               HEADER                      |
|------+------------------------------------|
|      |                                    |
|      |                                    |
| NAV  |        CONTENT                     |
|      |                                    |
|      |                                    |
+------+------------------------------------+
```

## Named Views

To use multiple views, we give each view a name.  Instead of defining a single `component:` property on the
state, we instead create a `views:` object on the state definition.  The object's keys are the names of the views, and
the values are the component names.


```js
var mainState = {
  name: 'main',
  views: {
    header: 'headerComponent',
    nav: 'navComponent',
    content: 'mainComponent',
  }
}
```

For angular 2:

```js
var mainState = {
  name: 'main',
  views: {
    header:{component:  headerComponent},
    nav: {component: navComponent},
    content:{component:  mainComponent},
  }
}
```

## Targeting a named `ui-view`

Those named views then target a `ui-view` with the matching name.

```html
<ui-view name="header"></ui-view>
<ui-view name="nav"></ui-view>
<div ui-view="content"></div>
```

When the `main` state is activated:

- Its `header` view fills the `<ui-view name="header"></ui-view>`
- Its `nav` view fills the `<ui-view name="nav"></ui-view>`
- Its `content` view fills the `<div ui-view="content"></div>`
