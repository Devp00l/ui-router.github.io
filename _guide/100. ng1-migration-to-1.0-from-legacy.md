UI-Router legacy (version 0.x.x) has been the defacto standard for routing in Angular 1 applications.
UI-Router 1.0.0+ offers significant benefits over the legacy version.


# New Features

## Route to component

In legacy UI-Router, a state's view consisted of a template and a controller.
The industry, however, has embraced a component based paradigm.

UI-Router 1.0 routes directly to an Angular 1.5 `.component()`.

See the [`component:`](https://ui-router.github.io/docs/latest/interfaces/ng1.ng1viewdeclaration.html#component) docs
and the [`bindings:`](https://ui-router.github.io/docs/latest/interfaces/ng1.ng1viewdeclaration.html#bindings) docs.

## State Hook: `redirectTo`

UI-Router 1.0 adds the `redirectTo` property to a state definition.

A common feature request has been to define the default substate of some state. 
When a user tries to activate that state, the Transition will be redirected to the substate found in the `redirectTo:` property.

This property can redirect to any state, not just substates.
{: .notice-info}

This property can be a function and can return a promise for an asynchronous redirect.
{: .notice-info}

See the [`redirectTo:`](https://ui-router.github.io/docs/latest/interfaces/state.statedeclaration.html#redirectto) docs.

## View Hook: `uiCanExit`

We've added a view hook for controllers to determine if their state can be exited or not.
This hook is useful to prompt for confirmation before exiting a screen with "dirty" information, for instance.

If the state that the view belongs to is going to be exited during a Transition, the hook on the controller is invoked.
Since it is a Transition Hook, it supports asynchronous callbacks (you could use a ui-bootstrap confirmation `$modal`, or check something on the server, if needed).

See the [`uiCanExit`](https://ui-router.github.io/docs/latest/interfaces/ng1.ng1controller.html#uicanexit) docs

## Dynamic Parameters

Normally, when a parameter value changes, it causes the state to be reloaded (exited and then re-entered).
In contrast, when a dynamic parameter changes, it does not cause the state to be reloaded.

This can be useful, e.g., on a search state to fetch new search results without reloading the state or views.

See the [ParamDeclaration](https://ui-router.github.io/docs/latest/interfaces/params.paramdeclaration.html#dynamic)  docs
and the [uiOnParamsChanged](https://ui-router.github.io/docs/latest/interfaces/ng1.ng1controller.html#uionparamschanged) docs.

## Transition Hooks

Transition Hooks allow a developer to hook into the Transition lifecycle, and modify the Transition's outcome.

In UI-Router legacy, people used the `$stateChangeStart`/`$stateChangeSuccess` events and `resolve` to handle concerns like redirects or authentication.

Transition Hooks are a huge improvement over the events.

Unlike the events, they fully embrace asynchronous processing, allow and dependency injection of resolves and services,
support first class Transiton redirects, and can target certain Transitions functionally, or declaratively using a criteria object. 

See the [TransitionService](https://ui-router.github.io/docs/latest/classes/transition.transitionservice.html) docs
for more details on how to register hooks.
    
## Transition Object

Instead of an endless list of parameters as in the state events of 0.2.x, all transition details are now 
fully encapsulated in the Transition object.
You can inspect parameters, origin and destination states, resolves, and trace back transition redirections.

See the [Transition](https://ui-router.github.io/docs/latest/classes/transition.transition-1.html) docs.

## Resolve policy

In UI-Router legacy, all resolves for a transition were processed at the same time when the Transition starts.
This could cause problems because resolves could be fetched for a state that had not yet been entered.

UI-Router 1.0 waits to fetch a state's resolves until that state is being entered.

However a state may declare a resolve as "EAGER" to cause it to be fetched when the Transition starts if desired.

See the [resolvePolicy:](https://ui-router.github.io/docs/latest/interfaces/state.statedeclaration.html#resolvepolicy) docs
and the [ResolvePolicy](https://ui-router.github.io/docs/latest/interfaces/resolve.resolvepolicy.html) docs.

## UI-Router visualizer

The new Transition pipeline and hooks enabled us to create the UI-Router Visualizer.

The State Visualizer provides a graphical view of the UI-Router State Tree, highlighting the active state.
A state selector allows a developer to transition between the states when developing.

The Transition Visualizer shows a timeline of all UI-Router transitions.
Each Transition's status (running/success/failure/ignored) is color coded.
The details of each Transition (to state/from state/parameters/resolve data) may be inspected.

See the [Visualizer project homepage](https://github.com/ui-router/visualizer) for details on how to add this to your app.

# Full Rewrite

We completely rewrote the internal implementations of much of the UI-Router code base.
This has resulted in a more robust, more flexible design, which addressed many of the communityâ€™s biggest requests and most pressing concerns.

The entire codebase has been converted to Typescript, enabling explicit API parameter types.

We've split out the UI-Router core code and made it framework agnostic.
This allowed us to quickly implement UI-Router for Angular 2 and UI-Router for React.
