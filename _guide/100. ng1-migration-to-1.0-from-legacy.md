UI-Router legacy (version 0.x.x) has been the defacto standard for routing in Angular 1 applications.
UI-Router 1.0.0+ offers significant benefits over the legacy version.


# New Features

## Route to component

In legacy UI-Router, a state's view consisted of a template and a controller.
The industry, however, has embraced a component based paradigm.

UI-Router 1.0 routes directly to an Angular 1.5 `.component()`.

See the [`component:`](https://ui-router.github.io/docs/latest/interfaces/ng1.ng1viewdeclaration.html#component) docs
and the [`bindings:`](https://ui-router.github.io/docs/latest/interfaces/ng1.ng1viewdeclaration.html#bindings) docs.

## State Hook: `redirectTo`

UI-Router 1.0 adds the `redirectTo` property to a state definition.

A common feature request has been to define the default substate of some state. 
When a user tries to activate that state, the Transition will be redirected to the substate found in the `redirectTo:` property.

This property can redirect to any state, not just substates.
{: .notice-info}

This property can be a function and can return a promise for an asynchronous redirect.
{: .notice-info}

See the [`redirectTo:`](https://ui-router.github.io/docs/latest/interfaces/state.statedeclaration.html#redirectto) docs.

## View Hook: `uiCanExit`

We've added a view hook for controllers to determine if their state can be exited or not.
This hook is useful to prompt for confirmation before exiting a screen with "dirty" information, for instance.

If the state that the view belongs to is going to be exited during a Transition, the hook on the controller is invoked.
Since it is a Transition Hook, it supports asynchronous callbacks (you could use a ui-bootstrap confirmation `$modal`, or check something on the server, if needed).

See the [`uiCanExit`](https://ui-router.github.io/docs/latest/interfaces/ng1.ng1controller.html#uicanexit) docs

## Dynamic Parameters

Normally, when a parameter value changes, it causes the state to be reloaded (exited and then re-entered).
In contrast, when a dynamic parameter changes, it does not cause the state to be reloaded.

This can be useful, e.g., on a search state to fetch new search results without reloading the state or views.

See the [ParamDeclaration](https://ui-router.github.io/docs/latest/interfaces/params.paramdeclaration.html#dynamic)  docs
and the [uiOnParamsChanged](https://ui-router.github.io/docs/latest/interfaces/ng1.ng1controller.html#uionparamschanged) docs.
