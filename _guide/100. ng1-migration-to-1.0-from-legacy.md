UI-Router legacy (version 0.x.x) has been the defacto standard for routing in Angular 1 applications.
UI-Router 1.0.0+ offers significant benefits over the legacy version.


# New Features

## Route to component

In legacy UI-Router, a state's view consisted of a template and a controller.
The industry, however, has embraced a component based paradigm.

UI-Router 1.0 routes directly to an Angular 1.5 `.component()`.

See the [`component:`](https://ui-router.github.io/docs/latest/interfaces/ng1.ng1viewdeclaration.html#component) docs
and the [`bindings:`](https://ui-router.github.io/docs/latest/interfaces/ng1.ng1viewdeclaration.html#bindings) docs.
