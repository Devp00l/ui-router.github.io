In case you missed it, four new UI-Router guides have been published this summer.

### [Views](/guides/views)
 
This guide provides information about how UI-Router handles views, including:

- Views (for a state)
- UI-Views (viewports)
- Nested views
- Multiple named views
- View targeting

### [Transitions](/guides/transitions)
 
This guide describes how UI-Router transitions between application states.
It explains concepts such as:
 
- What a Transition is
- Transition lifecycle events
- To and from states
- Entered and exited states
- Nested states
- Atomic transition behavior

### [Transition Hooks](/guides/transitionhooks)

Transition Hooks are a very powerful feature allowing you to hook into transition lifecycle events:
This guide explains how to:

- Perform asynchronous actions during a transition
- Redirect or abort transitions
- Choose which transitions to hook into

### [Lazy Loading](/guides/lazyloading)

Lazy loading allows an application to be split into smaller chunks.
This can drastically reduce the initial bundle size, allowing apps to load and bootstrap much faster.
This guide explains:

- General purpose lazy loading capability of UI-Router
- Module lazy loading
- Future States
- Framework specific approaches
