### New Guide: Migrate to UI-Router 1.0

We have published [a new guide](/guide/ng1/migrate-to-1_0) for migrating an 
Angular UI-Router application to UI-Router 1.0.

This guide details the new features available in the 1.0 version.
It also lists all known breaking changes when migrating from the legacy (0.2.x, 0.3.x) versions.
Workarounds for most breaking changes are provided.

UI-Router 1.0 brings a massive architecture change while retaining nearly 100% API backwards compatibility.
The architecture change enables the powerful new Transition Hook APIs. 

Additionally, splitting out the core code from the angular specific code paved the way 
for [UI-Router for Angular 2](/ng2/) and [UI-Router for React](/react/).
