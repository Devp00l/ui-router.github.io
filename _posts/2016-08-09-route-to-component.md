### New Guide: Route to components

We have published [a new guide](/guide/ng1/route-to-component)
detailing how to route to components using UI-Router 1.0.

The `.component()` method in Angular 1.5 provides a simple approach to composing user interfaces.
With this model, applications are composed of small, self contained components.

Components explicitly couple markup (DOM) and controller (logic).
They also explicitly define inputs and outputs, making data flow easier to reason about.

UI-Router 1.0 routes directly to Angular 1.5 components.
It can even wire up resolve data to component inputs.

Read all about routing to components in the [Route to Components guide](/guide/ng1/route-to-component).
