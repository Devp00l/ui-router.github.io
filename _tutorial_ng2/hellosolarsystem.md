In this tutorial, we will build on [Hello World!](helloworld) and create a slightly more ambitious _Hello Solar System_ app.

We will implement a [list/detail interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93detail_interface), 
also known as master-detail.
To accomplish this, we will create two new application states:

- The `people` state will show a list of all the people.
- The `person` state will show details for a specific person.

At any time, the user can click "reload plunker", and the app will restart at the same URL.
The URL contains the information necessary to restore the application's state.
When the app is restarted, it will be in the same state as before.
{: .notice--info}

Plunker embeds can time out.
If you get a "Not Found" response, your plunker embed has timed out.
Click the "Refresh" icon to get a new plunker, then try experimenting with the "reload plunker" button again.
{: .notice--info}

## Live demo

Take a look at the completed Hello Solar System live demo below.
Click the `uiSref` labeled "People" to view the list of all people.
Click a person to view the person details.

As you navigate through the app, the [UI-Router State Visualizer](https://github.com/ui-router/visualizer) shows
the current state

# New concepts

This app introduces some new concepts and UI-Router features.

- [UIRouterConfig](#uirouter-config)
- [Resolve data](#resolve-data)
- [State Parameters](#state-parameters)
- [Linking with params](#linking-with-params)

## UIRouter Config

You can perform router configuration or run initialization code before the router starts.
Supply a `configClass` to `provideUIRouter()`.

```js
import {MyUIRouterConfig} from "./config/router.config.js";
...
  providers: [
    provideUIRouter({ configClass: MyUIRouterConfig, useHash: true }),
    ...
  ]
```

The class will be injected (like a Angular 2 Service) by the DI system.
When UIRouter bootstraps, it will call the object's `configure()` function and pass the `UIRouter` object instance.

```
/** UIRouter Config  */
@Injectable()
export class MyUIRouterConfig {
  constructor(@Inject(PeopleService) peopleService) {
    // Plunker embeds can time out.  
    // Pre-load the people list at startup.
    peopleService.getAllPeople();
  }
  
  configure(router: UIRouter) {
    // If no URL matches, go to the `hello` state by default
    router.urlRouterProvider.otherwise(() => router.stateService.go('hello'));
    
    // Use ui-router-visualizer to show the states as a tree
    StateTree.create(router, document.getElementById('statetree'), { width: 200, height: 100 });
  }
}
```


## Resolve data

When a user switches back and forth between states of a single page web 
app, the app often needs to fetch application data from a server API, 
such as a REST endpoint.

A state can specify the data it requires by defining a `resolve:` property.
When the user tries to activate a state which has a `resolve:` property,
UI-Router will fetch the required data *before activating the state*.
The fetched data is then bound to the state's component(s).

The `resolve:` property on a state definition is an array. 
Each element of the array is an object which defines some data to be fetched.
The object has the Dependency Injection `token` (name) for the data being loaded.
It has a `resolveFn` which returns a promise for the data.
It also has a `deps` property, used to define the DI tokens for the `resolveFn`'s dependencies (function parameters).
{: .notice--info}

The `resolve` property of the `people` state is an array containing a single object.
The object defines how to fetch the `people` data, and assigns it a DI `token` (its name).

```js
resolve: [
  { 
    token: 'people',
    deps: [PeopleService], 
    resolveFn: (peopleSvc) => peopleSvc.getAllPeople()
  }
]
```

The object defines a `resolveFn` which returns a promise for all the people data.
The `resolveFn` is injected with the `PeopleService` because the first element of the `deps` property is the `PeopleService` token.
The data is assigned a DI `token` of `'people'`.
{: .notice--info}

When fetching data, we recommend delegating to services which return promises.
{: .notice--info}

UI-Router waits until the promise returned from `PeopleService.getAllPeople()` resolves before activating the `people` state.
The `People` component is created, and the list of people is fed into the component's `people:` `@Input()`.

```js
export class People { 
  @Input() people;
}
```


## State Parameters

We also want to allow the user to be able view the details for a specific person.
The `person` state takes a `personId` parameter, and uses it to fetch that specific person's details.

The parameter value is included as a part of the URL.
This enables the same person details to be shown when the plunker is reloaded.

The `person` state definition:

```js
export const personState = {
  name: 'person',
  url: '/people/:personId',
  component: Person,
  resolve: [
    { 
      token: 'person', 
      deps: [Transition, PeopleService],
      resolveFn: (trans, peopleSvc) => peopleSvc.getPerson(trans.params().personId)
    }
  ]
}
```

The URL will reflect the current `personId` parameter value, e.g., `/people/21`
{: .notice--info}

The `person` resolve delegates to PeopleService to fetch the correct person.
It passes the `personId` parameter, which it received from the `Transition` object.
The `Transition` is a special injectable object with information about the current state transition.
{: .notice--info}

### Linking with params

Note that our app's main Navigation Bar links to three states: `hello`, `about`, and `people`,
but it doesn't include a link directly to the `person` state.
This is because the state cannot be activated without a parameter value for the `personId` parameter.

In the `people` state we create links to the `person` state for each person.
We still create the link using `uiSref`, but we also include the `personId` parameter value.
As we loop over each person object using `*ngFor`, we provide the `uiSref` with the `personId` using each person's `.id` property.

{% raw %}
```js
<li *ngFor="let person of people">
  <a uiSref="person" [uiParams]="{ personId: person.id }">
    {{person.name}}
  </a>
 </li>
```
{% endraw %}
