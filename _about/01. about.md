## Client-side routing

A client-side router updates the browser URL as the user nagivates through the single page app.  
Conversely, changes to the browser's URL can drive navigation of the app, enabling
a user to create deep-links (i.e., bookmarks) to areas deep within the application.

The simplest form of client-side routing maps a screen in the app to a url.  For instance, the Contacts
screen might map to the url `/contacts`, while the Preferences screen might map to the url `/prefs`.
